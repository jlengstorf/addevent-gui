## AddEvent GUI

[AddEvent](https://www.addevent.com/) is a handy tool for giving people links that allow them to add things to their calendar. They have an API for [creating short links](https://www.addevent.com/api/direct-url-method), but there’s no UI for it and I’m far too lazy to look this up every time I need a short link.

So this is a quick-and-dirty form that scratches my itch. It doesn't support all of the API’s options, so if you want to use this and need different options, feel free to fork or submit a PR.

This is built with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org).
